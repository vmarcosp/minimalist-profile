  "biography": "I'm Aarushi Parashar, a Freshman majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Applied Mathematics and Operations Research and Management Sciences at Cornell University. Among my interests are neural networks,/cognitive computing development, cloud and distributed computing, autonomous systems, and software engineering. In school, I am currently a software engineer at Cornell Mars Rover(CMR), a project team that designs and builds an autonomous rover.  This summer I am a research intern at IBM working on building various neural network models to predict whether a small molecule will bind to a protein. This is currently my temporary website, so stay tuned for the official one to replace this sometime soon!",
